# data folder

The structue of the data folder is as follows:

1) **raw**:
	* armco_numerical_simulation
	Contains an extended dataset from the data obtained from an FE analysis for ARMCO pure iron described in 
	  (A. H. Astaraee, S. Bagherifard, S. Monti, and M. Guagliano, _Evaluating the homogeneity of surface features induced by impact‐based surface treatments_, Materials (Basel)., vol. 14, no. 13, Jul. 2021.). 
	  The process was established and validated for carburized steel in (A. Heydari Astaraee et al., _Application of shot peening to case-hardened steel gears: the effect of gradient material properties and component geometry_, Surf. Coatings Technol., vol. 398, p. 126084, 2020.)
	  **format**: the data is given as csv file which were converted from excel files.
